        It is imperative to give the young seedlings special attention in the first few weeks after germination. Young and
         tender seedlinaAQgs growing in nursery beds are easier and more economical to care for in a small area than in the mail planting field.
        Vegetative propagation is the most common method of propagating fruit crops. Prior to transplanting propagules in the main field, special skill and aftercare are necessary. All of these tasks can be successfully performed by skilled labor in a nursery under controlled conditions.

        The best conditions for rooting cuttings and hardening grafts are provided by the mist house chamber in a nursery.
        When compared to transplanting of seedlings raised in nurseries, direct sowing is less successful in several crops.

        It is necessary to replace plantation casualties either in the year of planting or in the following year. Due to weed suppression, sowing done in the gaps are likely to be unsuccessful. They will not catch up with plant growth from the original sowing. Plants or stumps grown in nurseries are invariably used to replace casualties, so nurseries are indispensable. For causality replacement in orchards, hardened nursery plants are preferred.

        Furthermore, it provides more time for pre-planting operations/preparations when seedlings or saplings are raised in nursery.

        A nursery is the only place where seedlings can be hardened against natural elements.

        There are some plant species that dont seed every year. It is difficult to raise plants of these species each year. This problem can be solved by collecting all the available seeds from years of good seed production and sowing them in a nursery to raise seedlings that can be transplanted in subsequent years.

        The seedlings of some species grow very slowly, and if they are sown directly in main field, they are most likely to become overwhelmed by weeds and die. For this reason, slow-growing species are generally raised in nurseries and planted out only when weeds are unlikely to damage the seedlings.
        In order to artificially regenerate barren and poor farming sites, nursery grown plants are the most reliable method.   </p>
