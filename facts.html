    <p>nursery, place where plants are grown for transplanting,
        r use as stock for budding and grafting, or for sale. Commercial nurseries produce and distribute woody and herbaceous plants, including ornamental trees, shrubs, and bulb crops. While most nursery-grown plants are ornamental, the nursery business also includes fruit plants and certain perennial vegetables used in home gardens (e.g., asparagus, rhubarb). Some nurseries are kept for the propagation of native plants for ecological restoration. Greenhouses may be used for tender plants or to keep production going year round, 
        urseries most commonly consist of shaded or exposed areas outside. Plants are commonly cultivated from seed or from cuttings and
        often grown in pots or other temporary containers. See also floriculture.Heard about weird species like Venus flytrap or poison ivy? The following information about plants for kids is a veritable treat for those who love interesting facts related to the magnificent plant kingdom:

        We human beings use more than 2000 different types of plants to create various delicious food items in our meals.
        Bamboo is an extremely rapid growing plant. In fact, some bamboo varieties can grow almost a metre (about 3.2 feet) in a single day2. Did you know: that the gingko tree (Gingko biloba) is among the most ancient of plants still in existence? Considered a living fossil, it’s said to have survived, unchanged, for more than 200 million years. It’s also a lonely specimen, being the only one of its species, with no known living relatives. With its roots in China, the gingko (or maidenhair tree) has made its way around the world to become a popular landscape tree, despite the fact that the female produces foul-smelling fruit (best to spec a male, if you want to maintain good client relations).

        3. Did you know: that Arbor Day this year is April 24? Arbor Day was first observed as a formal holiday in 1872. It began in Nebraska, and 
        credit for its founding is given to journalist J. Sterling Morton. It’s said that on the origin
        al day—April 10—Nebraskans planted more than a million trees. The observation gained popularity
         across the nation and by 1920, more than 45 states and territories were celebrating Arbor Day
          (some on the day of their choosing). What’s more, the 1,700-acre Morton Arboretum in Lisle,
           Illinois, was founded in 1922 by Joy Morton (also founder of the Morton Salt Company),
            the eldest son of J. Sterling.</p>
